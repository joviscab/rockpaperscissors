# Third Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors!

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This is the third project called Rock Paper Scissors, that is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Javascript knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Rock Paper Scissors game, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The game for now it is playable only by the commandline.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Javascript skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
